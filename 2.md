### Remembering

---

#### Few presentations away..

---

### Dockerfile in deep

#### Anatomy of a dockerfile

```
FROM python-alpine 

LABEL "maintainer"="some@example.com"
LABEL "rating"="Five Stars" "class"="First Class"

USER root

ENV APP /data/app

# Application Code
WORKDIR $APP 
COPY ./some.txt some.txt
RUN ls

CMD ["python3","-m","http.server"]
```

---

#### Base images

```
FROM python-alpine 
```

---

```
LABEL "maintainer"="some@example.com"
LABEL "rating"="Five Stars" "class"="First Class"
```

#### NOTE

```
MAINTAINER is a deprecated field in the Dockerfile specification. It was designed to
provided contact information for the Dockerfile’s author, but Docker now recommends
simply using a label for this purpose.
```

---

```
USER root

ENV APP /data/app
```

#### CAUTION

```
Even though containers provide some isolation from the underlying operating system, they
still run on the host kernel. Due to potential security risks, production containers should
almost always be run under the context of a nonprivileged user.
```

---

#### Code specific stuffs

```
# Application Code
WORKDIR $APP 
COPY ./some.txt some.txt
RUN ls
```

---

### Command for the image

```
CMD ["python3","-m","http.server"]
```

---

### ADD vs COPY

```
Copy just copy
COPY src dest
```

```
Add download from urls and decompress .tar files
ADD src dest
```

---


### Entrypoint

`ENTRYPOINT` has two forms:
```
ENTRYPOINT ["executable", "param1", "param2"] (exec form, preferred)
ENTRYPOINT command param1 param2 (shell form)
```

---

### ENTRYPOINT vs CMD

#### ONLY ENTRYPOINT

```
FROM python-alpine
ENTRYPOINT ["ping", "localhost"]
```

#### OVERRYDING

```
docker run --entrypoint=ping test-some google.com
```

---

#### ONLY CMD

```
FROM ubuntu:trusty
CMD ["/bin/ping","localhost"]
```

---

#### ENTRYPOINT and CMD

```
FROM ubuntu:trusty
ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/ping","-c","3"]
CMD ["localhost"]
```

---

### Building the image

```
docker build -t example/docker­example:latest .
```
